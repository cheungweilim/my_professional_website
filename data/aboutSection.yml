  ### I build and integrate awesome Data Science Applications
  
  I love to develop data-driven applications that will provide more opportunities. But, when I'm not building new apps, I do sports and play games with family and friends. 


  My focus is on the application of Data Science in business. I add value to companies by understanding business problems. 
  
  
  I create data-driven solutions to help stakeholders make better decisions using data.
